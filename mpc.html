							<p>For this project I got inspired by Udacity <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013">self-driving car nanodegree</a> Model Predictive Control Project. This was an extremely interesting (and challenging) project to complete. I am going to discuss a bit the theorical details before discussing my implementation and showing the results. </p>

							<h3>What's MPC?</h3>
							<p>The goal of the controller is to calculate the input/s to a system such that a desired reference is followed by its output. A model predictive controller accomplishes this by predicting the behaviour of the system's output and using an optimizer to find the best possible sequence of inputs. The main adavantage of this approach is that it can control complex <a> Multiple-Inputs Multiple-Outputs</a> systems and can handle multiple constrains. To further explain MPC applied to self-driving cars in a simple (I hope) way, there is a scheme of the control loop wich I will discuss: </p>
							<!-- <div class="box alt"> -->
							<div class="row gtr-uniform">
						  <p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/mpc/diagram.png" alt=""/></span>
							Here MPC is used to keep the car's path (the system's <b> output </b>) to the middle of the lane (the controller's <b> reference</b>) by commanding the steering sequence (the system's <b> intput </b>). How it does that? At the current time, the MPC controller uses the car model to simulate the carâ€™s path for the next T time steps (this is referred as the controller's <b> prediction horizon </b>) if the steering wheel would be turned in a certain way.</p>
							<p>To find the sequence that minimizes the distance of the predicted car's path from the center of the lane by performing many simulations and approaches the search of the best steering sequence as an <b>optimization problem</b>. The cost function J of this optimization problem hence penalizes paths with large overall error but can also pensalize sharp steering changes so to have a smooth driving, so the predicted path with the smallest J gives the <em>optimal</em> solution. </p>
							<p>MPC applies only the first step of this optimal sequence to the car. Based on the applied steering wheel angle, the car will travel some distance and the MPC will get a new measurement of the car's position, this may be different than what was predicted due to unmeasured disturbances (slippery road, etc... ). At the next time step, the prediction horizon shifts forward and the controller repeats the same cycle of calculations to compute the optimal steering wheel angle for the next time step. </p>

							<h3>Kinematic Modelling</h3>
							<!-- <div class="box alt"> -->
							<div class="row gtr-uniform">
						  <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/mpc/mpc_2_alt.png" alt="" width="50%"/></span>
							The MPC model is based on kinematic <a href="https://www.coursera.org/lecture/intro-self-driving-cars/lesson-2-the-kinematic-bicycle-model-Bi8yE">bicycle model</a> defined by four <b>state variables</b> <code>x = [x-position, y-position, velocity, heading]</code> and two <b>input variables</b> <code>u = [steering angle, acceleration]</code>.
							<br>The continuous model has been discretized according Euler's formula with a timestep <em>dt</em>. Altough it is a requirement of the optimization library that the system model should be <em>linear</em>, this is not the case due to trigonometric functions. So the linear system dynamics have been approximated using <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/aeronautics-and-astronautics/16-30-feedback-control-systems-fall-2010/lecture-notes/MIT16_30F10_lec05.pdf"> Taylor's series expansion</a>, so that the state equations could be in the LTI form <code>x_tplus = A*x_t + B*u_t</code></p>
							</div>
							<!-- </div> -->

							<h3>Optimization Problem</h3>
							<!-- <div class="box alt"> -->
							<div class="row gtr-uniform">
							<p>This is the actual cost function I used to solve the optimization problem at each time step t. It consists of three terms in <em>quadratic form</em>:
								<ul>
									<li>Tracking-error <b>delta_x</b>: error from desired car state, wich include position as well velocity and desired heading.</li>
									<li>Actuaction effort <b>u</b>: amplitude of the input, this is usefull for minimizing the energy used.</li>
									<li>Actuaction rate of change <b>delta_u</b>: change in the input from one time step to the next, this is useful to have smooth driving.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>

							<p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/mpc/mpc.png" alt="" /></span></p>

							<p>The <b>weight coefficients</b> Q, R and K are used to tune the response of the controller. Moreover, for the solution to be meaningful, the optimizer has to mantain several <b>contraints</b>:
							<div>
								<ul>
									<li>Starting condition of the car's state at time step t equals the latest measurement.</li>
									<li>The predicted dynamics have to obey the Linear Model between time steps, this is how the optimzer actually "simulates".</li>
									<li>Maximum (and minimum) acceleration and steering angle have to be within those allowed by the car.</li>
									<li>Maximum (and minimum) acceleration and steering angle rate of change have to be within those allowed by the car.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							</div>

							</div>
							<!-- </div> -->

							<h3>Tracking Reference</h3>
						  <p>The track is represented by a collection of evenly spaced points. This can be used very easily build the reference trajectory for the car:

							<ul>
								<li> TODO... </li>
								<li> TODO... </li>
								<li> TODO... </li>
							</ul>
							</div>
							</p>

							<h3>Implementation</h3>
							<div>
						  <p>Now we are done with math (phew...). The Controller was implemented in Python using <a href="">CVXPY</a> optimization library using the <a href="">OSQP</a> solver. It solves convex (hence why everything had to be in linear form) problems very efficiently, wich allows the controller to run in tral time with a dt of 200 milliseconds.
							This is what an optimization loop is implemented: </br>
							<pre><code>#CVXPY Linear MPC problem statement
P = mpc_configuration()
cost = 0
constr = []
x = cp.Variable((P.N, P.T+1))
u = cp.Variable((P.M, P.T))

# Cost Matrices
Q = np.diag([20,20,10,0])   #state error cost
Qf = np.diag([10,10,10,10]) #state final error cost
R = np.diag([10,10])        #input cost
K = np.diag([10,10])        #input rate of change cost

#Get Reference_traj
x_ref, d_ref = get_ref_trajectory(x_bar[:,0] ,track, REF_VEL)

#Prediction Horizon
for t in range(P.T):

    # Tracking Error
    cost += cp.quad_form(x[:,t] - x_ref[:,t], Q)

    # Actuation effort
    cost += cp.quad_form(u[:,t], R)

    # Actuation rate of change
    if t < (P.T - 1):
        cost += cp.quad_form(u[:,t+1] - u[:,t], K)
        constr+= [cp.abs(u[0, t + 1] - u[0, t])/P.dt <= MAX_D_ACC]    #max acc rate of change
        constr += [cp.abs(u[1, t + 1] - u[1, t])/P.dt <= MAX_D_STEER] #max steer rate of change

    # Kinrmatics Constrains (Linearized model)
    A,B,C = get_linear_model(x_bar[:,t], u_bar[:,t])
    constr += [x[:,t+1] == A@x[:,t] + B@u[:,t] + C.flatten()]

# sums problem objectives and concatenates constraints.
constr += [x[:,0] == x_bar[:,0]]           #starting condition
constr += [x[2,:] <= MAX_SPEED]           #max speed
constr += [x[2,:] >= 0.0]                 #min_speed (not really needed)
constr += [cp.abs(u[0,:]) <= MAX_ACC]     #max acc
constr += [cp.abs(u[1,:]) <= MAX_STEER]   #max steer

# Solve
prob = cp.Problem(cp.Minimize(cost), constr)
prob.solve(solver=cp.OSQP, verbose=False)</code></pre>
							For the simulation I used <a href="https://pybullet.org/wordpress/">Pybullet</a> (my favourite!) with a miniature racing car <a href="https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3/tree/master/examples/pybullet/gym/pybullet_data/racecarPybullet"> f10 </a>.
							</p>
							</div>

							<p><h2>Results</h2>
							Finally, here are some results: on the right is the actual racecar in pybullet, while on the left is a plotted demo of the MPC. I am quite happy how it turned out. Unfortunately it performs weirdly near sharp corners (due to the polynomial fitting...) but it recovers very well and converges nicely.
							 The green line is a visualization of the MPC predicted path over the control horizon.</p>
